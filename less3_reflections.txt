Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> Either when I am collaborating with other users or when I want to save my project files on cloud.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--> It gives us flexibility in the sense that both can be standalone projects. We can always pull the change we want to have.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

--> Fork is used to copy repositories on GitHub server. Clones are used to copy repositories from github to the local computer,vice-versa and in the local server. Branches are used when implementing different features or making provate changes.
