Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> Either when I am collaborating with other users or when I want to save my project files on cloud.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--> It gives us flexibility in the sense that both can be standalone projects. We can always pull the change we want to have.
